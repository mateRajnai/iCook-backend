# iCook-backend

## What is iCook about? Let me explain.
Everybody wanted to cook something at least once. The first place where you will search is the internet. 
This is where iCook come in the picture. You can search and manage your favorite recipes and also could share some thoughts or little cooking secrets with the others.  
iCook can help you with:
  - Without registration:  
    :heavy_check_mark: Detailed search for recipes  
    :heavy_check_mark: Checkout recipe details  
    :heavy_check_mark: You can even get a random drink suggestion
  - After you created an account:  
    :heavy_check_mark: Save your favorites  
    :heavy_check_mark: Share your thoughts in a form of a comment  
    :heavy_check_mark: Add personal note(s) to recipes
 
Sadly some features are implemented partly:  
  - Add tags to recipes 
  - User can save his/her address
  
There are some planned features:  
  - Detailed user page  
  - Search recipes by tags  
  - Create your own recipes  
  - Search grocery stores by geolocation or address
